Exercise 1
In this five-part exercise, we will count the frequency of each letter in a given string.

      Exercise 1a

      Import the string library.
      Create a variable alphabet that consists of the lowercase and uppercase letters in the English alphabet using the ascii_letters 
      data attribute of the string library.

      Exercise 1b

      The lower and upper case letters of the English alphabet should stored as the string variable alphabet.
      Consider the sentence 'Jim quickly realized that the beautiful gowns are expensive'. 
      Create a dictionary count_letters with keys consisting of each unique letter in the sentence and values consisting of the number of 
      times each letter is used in this sentence. 
      Count upper case and lower case letters separately in the dictionary.

      Exercise 1d


      Abraham Lincoln was a president during the American Civil War. His famous 1863 Gettysburg Address has been stored as address.

conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a 
great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 
We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final 
resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper 
that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- 
this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add 
or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so 
nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored 
dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here 
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."""

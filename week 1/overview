Week 1 serves as a refresher of basic Python concepts with which you should already be familiar. 
Remember, this course assumes some prior knowledge of Python programming (in any version of Python). 
If you're an experienced programmer with coding skills using another language, this Week 1 refresher can also introduce you to the 
Python syntax you will need throughout the rest of the course.

In Week 1, you will review:

  - Python data types (lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc.)
  - Statements (if, while, for, etc.)
  - Dynamic typing
  - Functions
  - Common errors and how to fix them
  
  
Week 1 is divided into three parts. Part 1 covers objects and methods. Part 2 covers sequence objects such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. 
Part 3 covers manipulating objects. Comprehension Checks follow most videos. There is also one Homework assignment that will allow you to 
practice your coding skills.

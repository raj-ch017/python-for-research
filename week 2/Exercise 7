      Exercise 7

      In the next few exercises, we will make functions that verify if either player has won the game.

      Instructions:
      
      Make a function col_win(board, player) that takes the player (integer) and determines if any column consists of only their marker.
      Have it return True if this condition is met and False otherwise.
      board is already defined from previous exercises. Call col_win to check if Player 1 has a complete row.

# code:

def col_win(board,player):

    if np.any(np.all(board==player,axis=0)):
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
col_win(board,1)

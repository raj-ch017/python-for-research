      Exercise 9

      In the next few exercises, we will make functions that check whether either player has won the game.

      Instructions:
      
      Create a function evaluate(board) that uses row_win, col_win, and diag_win functions for both players. 
      If one of them has won, return that player's number. If the board is full but no one has won, return -1. Otherwise, return 0.
      board is already defined from previous exercises. Call evaluate to see if either player has won the game yet.

    winner = 0
    check_list = []
    for player in [1, 2]:
        row_result = row_win(board,player)
        check_list.append(row_result)
        col_result = col_win(board,player)
        check_list.append(col_result)
        diag_result = diag_win(board,player)
        check_list.append(diag_result)

        if np.any(np.array(check_list) == True):
            winner = player

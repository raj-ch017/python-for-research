      Exercise 6

      In the next few exercises, we will make functions that check whether either player has won the game.

      Instructions:
      
      Make a function row_win(board, player) that takes the player (integer) and determines if any row consists of only their marker.
      Have it return True if this condition is met and False otherwise.
      board is already defined from previous exercises. Call row_win to check if Player 1 has a complete row.

#code:

def row_win(board,player):

    if np.any(np.all(board==player,axis=1)):
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
row_win(board,1)

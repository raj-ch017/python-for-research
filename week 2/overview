Tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses) is a simple strategy game in which two players take turns placing a mark on a 3x3 board, 
attempting to make a row, column, or diagonal of three with their mark. In this homework, we will use the tools we've covered in the past
two weeks to create a tic-tac-toe simulator and evaluate basic winning strategies.

In the following exercises, we will learn to create a tic-tac-toe board, place markers on the board, evaluate if either player has won, 
and use this to simulate two basic strategies.

      Exercise 2

      Players 1 and 2 will take turns changing values of this array from a 0 to a 1 or 2, 
      indicating the number of the player who places a marker there.

      
      Instructions:
      
      Create a function place(board, player, position), where:
      player is the current player (an integer 1 or 2).
      position is a tuple of length 2 specifying a desired location to place their marker.

Your function should only allow the current player to place a marker on the board (change the board position to their number) if that position is empty (zero).
Use create_board() to store a board as board, and use place to have Player 1 place a marker on location (0, 0).

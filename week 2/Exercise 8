      Exercise 8

      In the next few exercises, we will make functions that verify if either player has won the game.

      Instructions:
      
      Finally, create a function diag_win(board, player) that tests if either diagonal of the board consists of only their marker. 
      Have it return True if this condition is met, and False otherwise.
      board has been slightly modified from a previous exercise. Call diag_win to check if Player 2 has a complete diagonal.

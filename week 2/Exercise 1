      Exercise 1

      Tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses) is a simple strategy game in which two players take turns placing a mark on a 3x3 board, 
      attempting to make a row, column, or diagonal of three with their mark. In this homework, we will use the tools we've covered
      in the past two weeks to create a tic-tac-toe simulator and evaluate basic winning strategies.

In the following exercises, we will learn to create a tic-tac-toe board, place markers on the board, evaluate
if either player has won, and use this to simulate two basic strategies.

      Instructions:
      
      For our tic-tac-toe board, we will use a numpy array with dimension 3 by 3.
      Make a function create_board() that creates such a board with the value of each cell set to the integer 0.
      Call create_board() and store it.

#code:

import numpy as np

def create_board():
    
    the_board = np.zeros((3,3), dtype = int)
    return the_board


board = create_board()

      Exercise 4

      The next step is for the current player to place a marker among the available positions. 
      In this exercise, we will select an available board position at random and place a marker there.

      Instructions:
      
      Write a function random_place(board, player) that places a marker for the current player at 
      random among all the available positions (those currently set to 0).
      Find possible placements with possibilities(board).
      Select one possible placement at random using random.choice(selection).
      board is already defined from previous exercises. Call random_place(board, player) to place a 
      random marker for Player 2, and store this as board to update its value.

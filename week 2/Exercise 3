      Exercise 3

      In this exercise, we will determine which positions are available to either player for placing their marker.

      Instructions:
      
      Create a function possibilities(board) that returns a list of all positions (tuples) on the board
      that are not occupied (0). (Hint: numpy.where is a handy function that returns a list of indices that meet a condition.)

      board is already defined from previous exercises. Call possibilities(board) to see what it returns!

#code:

def possibilities(board):

    row_ind, col_ind = np.where(board == 0)
    out_list = []

    for val in range(len(row_ind)):
        r = row_ind[val]
        c = col_ind[val]
        out_list.append((r,c))
    
    return out_list

possibilities(board)

In Week 5, we explore statistical learning through a series of videos and comprehension checks followed by a two-part case study that 
allows you to practice your coding skills with homeworks. We will use the scikit-learn library, one of the most widely used Python libraries for 
machine learning.

In Week 5, you will:

  - Learn the basics of linear and logistic regression
  - Learn how to use scikit-learn to fit linear and logistic regression models
  - Learn the basics of random forest methods for regression and classification
  - Learn how to use scikit-learn to fit a random forest model
  - Apply the techniques learned to analyze a dataset of movies


Week 5 is divided into three parts followed by the case study. Part 1 covers linear regression, Part 2 covers logistic regression, and 
Part 3 covers random forest methods for regression and classification. Comprehension Checks follow each video. The week concludes with a 
two-part case study looking at a movie dataset with two Homeworks that will allow you to practice the coding techniques introduced in the videos.

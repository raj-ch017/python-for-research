It's time to continue putting the Python skills you've been acquiring to use in three more case studies! In Week 4, we will work through 
three case study examples of ways to apply Python to a research question, and then you'll get a chance to practice your coding skills with a 
homework associated with each case study.

In Week 4, you will:

  - Learn how to classify whisky
  - Learn how to use GPS data to track the migration patterns of birds
  - Learn how to analyze social networks
  
  
Week 4 is divided into three case studies: whisky classification, bird migration, and social network analysis. 
For each case study, there are introductory videos that go over the basic concepts involved with Comprehension Checks after most videos. 
There is also a Homework for each case study that will allow you to practice the coding techniques introduced in the videos.

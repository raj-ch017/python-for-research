      Exercise 2

      In this exercise, we will summarize the text for a single translation of Hamlet in a pandas dataframe.

      Instructions:
      
      Find the dictionary of word frequency in text by calling count_words_fast(). Store this as counted_text.
      Create a pandas dataframe named data.
      Using counted_text, define two columns in data:
      word, consisting of each unique word in text.
      count, consisting of the number of times each word in word is included in the text.
      
"""

#code:

language, text = hamlets.iloc[0]

counted_text = count_words_fast(text)

data = pd.DataFrame(columns = ["word","count"])
val = 0

for ele in counted_text:
    data.loc[val] = ele, counted_text[ele]
    val += 1

print(data.loc[data["word"] == "hamlet"])

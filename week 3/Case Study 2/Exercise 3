      Exercise 3

      In this exercise, we will continue to define summary statistics for a single translation of Hamlet.

      Instructions:
      
      Add a column to data named length, defined as the length of each word.
      Add another column named frequency, which is defined as follows for each word in data:
      If count > 10, frequency is "frequent".
      If 1 < count <= 10, frequency is "infrequent".
      If count == 1, frequency is "unique".
      
"""

#code:

data = pd.DataFrame(columns=["word","count","length","frequency"])
val = 0

for ele in counted_text:

    if counted_text[ele] > 10:
        data.loc[val] = ele,counted_text[ele],len(ele),"frequent"
    elif counted_text[ele] > 1 and counted_text[ele] <= 10:
        data.loc[val] = ele,counted_text[ele],len(ele),"infrequent"
    elif counted_text[ele] == 1:
        data.loc[val] = ele,counted_text[ele],len(ele),"unique"

    val += 1
    
print(len(data.loc[data["frequency"] == "unique"]))

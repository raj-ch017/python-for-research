      Exercise 4

      In this exercise, we will summarize the statistics in data into a smaller pandas dataframe.

      Instructions:
      
      Create a pandas dataframe named sub_data including the following columns:
      language, which is the language of the text (defined in Exercise 2).
      frequency, which is a list containing the strings "frequent", "infrequent", and "unique".
      mean_word_length, which is the mean word length of each value in frequency.
      num_words, which is the total number of words in each frequency category.
      
"""

#code:

sub_data = pd.DataFrame(columns=["language","frequency","mean_word_length","num_words"])
frequency_list = ["frequent","infrequent","unique"]

# - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - 
"""
    This part of the code calculate the mean word length for each frequency

        the_length += val

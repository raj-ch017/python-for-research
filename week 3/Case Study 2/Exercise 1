      Exercise 1:
      
      In this case study, we will find and visualize summary statistics of the text of different translations of Hamlet. 
      For this case study, functions count_words_fast and word_stats are already defined as in the Case 2 Videos (Videos 3.2.x).

      Instructions:
      
      Read in the data as a pandas dataframe using pd.read_csv. Use the index_col argument to set the first column in the csv file as the index for the dataframe. 
      
      The data can be found at https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:HarvardX+PH526x+2T2019+type@asset+block@hamlets.csv

#code:

hamlets = pd.read_csv("D:\Courses\Edx\Python for Research\hamlet_data.csv",index_col=0)

#print(hamlets)

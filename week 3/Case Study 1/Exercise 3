      Exercise 3

      In this exercise, we will encode a message with a Caesar cipher.

      Instructions:
      
      alphabet and positions have already been defined in previous exercises. Use positions
      to create an encoded message based on message where each character in message has been shifted forward by 1 position, as defined by positions.

      Note that you can ensure the result remains within 0-26 using result % 27
      Store this as encoded_message.

#code:

message = "hi my name is caesar"

encoded_message = ""

key_list = list(positions.keys())
val_list = list(positions.values())

for ele in message:
    the_val = positions[ele]
    new_val = the_val + 1
    
    if new_val % 27 <= 26:
        ind = val_list.index(new_val)
        new_ele = key_list[ind]
        encoded_message += new_ele
        
print(encoded_message)
